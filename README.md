# BINARY CLASSIFICATION OF CUSTOMER’S ONLINE PURCHASING BEHAVIOR USING MACHINE LEARNING
The growing trends in e-commerce has opened many new disciplines that require substantial explorations. Banking sector realized this importance long ago and are still curious to understand customer needs and behavior. There are various sub-areas to comprehend customers behavior based on offline customer profile, web-surfing meta data, call center communication and many more. In this research, our focus is to understand the behavior of a bank customer for subscribing a term-deposit that was offered though bank’s online catalog. For this purpose, we have selected a dataset from a banking institution that can be publicly accessible from UCI database. Using this dataset, we aim to use machine learning approaches that could answers our question by learning from the data. Out approach will be to wire-up multiple well-suitable supervised learning classification algorithms to form Ensembled Learning. Our primary results and analysis on given dataset shows 90% classification accuracy.
